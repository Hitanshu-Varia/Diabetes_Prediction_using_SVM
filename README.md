# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning (SVM & Scikit-learn)

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict diabetes in patients using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm with **Python** and **Scikit-learn**. The dataset used is the **Diabetes Dataset**, which is a popular dataset for binary classification tasks in healthcare.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements. The project includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- SVM model training and evaluation
- Visualization (optional)
- Accuracy and performance metrics

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [It is attached in the repo]
- **Attributes**:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age
  - Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
